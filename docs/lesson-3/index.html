One just needed to know three things: how to be born, how to die, and how to survive. </p><ul><li><strong>Birth rule</strong>: A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors will become alive.</li><li><strong>Death rule</strong>: Any live cell with zero or one live neighbors will die of loneliness; any live cell with four or more live neighbors will die of overcrowding.</li><li><strong>Survival rule</strong>: A live cell with two or three live neighbors will survive.</li></ul><p>
Let’s see these rules in action. </p><p><em>&lt;insert interactive module here&gt;</em>
<br/></p><p>At first glance, these rules seem far too simplistic to create anything interesting, right? 
Well, before we judge them too soon, let’s see an example of what Life looks like on a larger scale.</p><img src="../../static/images/game-of-life.gif" alt="game-of-life"/><br/><p>This seems... ridiculous. How could those three limited rules produce something that looks like <em>that</em>? 
Dare I say... something that looks <em>alive</em>?
This is the key to why Conway’s Life has been the object of so much fascination over the years: 
the idea that something so simple can lead to something unimaginably complex
makes one dream about the emergence of Life as we know it; and wonder if Nature, too, may abide by principles as simple as these. </p><form action="../lesson-4/"><button class="next" type="submit">
