    Can you see the similarities to a cellular automaton?</caption></span></span>
John Conway set out to find a set of rules for a cellular automaton that would produce interesting and unpredictable patterns. 
After a period of 18 long months, and with the help of copious amounts of tea and a Go board, Conway had done it — he had created Life! </p><p>The Game of Life <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/october1970.html">made its debut</a> in the October 1970 issue of Scientific American. 
Fellow mathematician Martin Gardner featured Life in his column “Mathematical Games”: 
a series of articles meant to introduce readers to the delights of mathematics and of puzzles and problem solving.
In this article, Gardner described Conway’s aims for his creation:</p><blockquote>1<!-- -->. There should be no initial pattern for which there is a simple proof that the population can grow without limit.</blockquote><blockquote>2<!-- -->. There should be initial patterns that apparently do grow without limit.</blockquote><blockquote>3<!-- -->. There should be simple initial patterns that grow and change for a considerable period of time before coming to end in three possible ways: fading away completely (from overcrowding or becoming too sparse), settling into a stable configuration that remains unchanged thereafter, or entering an oscillating phase in which they repeat an endless cycle of two or more periods.</blockquote><blockquote>In brief, the rules should be such as to make the behavior of the population unpredictable.</blockquote><p>as well as the three rules that ultimately fulfilled these aims.</p><form action="../lesson-3/"><button class="next" type="submit">
