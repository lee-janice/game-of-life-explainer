## Conway's goals

John Conway set out [mark]to find a set of rules that would produce interesting and varied patterns[/mark]. 
As fellow mathematician Martin Gardner would later describe in his Scientific American column "Mathematical Games", 
where the Game of Life [made its debut](http://www.ibiblio.org/lifepatterns/october1970.html), 
Conway searched for rules that would fulfill three characteristics:

[var images: `[
  { "url": "../../static/images/transparent.png", "title": "1. There should be no initial pattern for which there is a simple proof that the population can grow without limit."}, 
  { "url": "", "title": "2. There should be initial patterns that apparently do grow without limit."}, 
  { "url": "", "title": "3. There should be simple initial patterns that grow and change for a considerable period of time before coming to end in three possible ways: fading away completely (from overcrowding or becoming too sparse), settling into a stable configuration that remains unchanged thereafter, or entering an oscillating phase in which they repeat an endless cycle of two or more periods."}

// > 1. There should be no initial pattern for which there is a simple proof that the population can grow without limit.
// > 2. There should be initial patterns that apparently do grow without limit.
// > 3. There should be simple initial patterns that grow and change for a considerable period of time before coming to end in three possible ways: fading away completely (from overcrowding or becoming too sparse), settling into a stable configuration that remains unchanged thereafter, or entering an oscillating phase in which they repeat an endless cycle of two or more periods. 

Gardner summarized: [mark]In brief, the rules should be such as to make the behavior of the population unpredictable.[/mark]

Finding these rules proved to be a difficult task. 
If there were too many conditions where cells would become alive, everything would expand, or grow without limit.
If there were too many conditions where cells would die, everything would eventually die. 
Conway had to strike just the right balance.

## Experimenting with the rules

    Can you see the similarities to a cellular automaton?[/caption]
[/Aside]
Since Conway was working on Life back in 1970, he didn't have the luxury of computing power that we have today,
meaning that he had to calculate the next state of his automata by hand.
Since he was an avid [Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game) player, 
he enlisted the help of a Go board to keep track of the states.
After a period of 18 long months, and with the help of teatime and his Go board, 
Conway had done it — he had created Life!

## Knowledge check

Before we reveal the rules that he discovered, try experimenting yourself with the automaton below. 

[var name:"birth" value:`[1, 2, 3]` /] 
[var name:"survival" value:`[4, 5, 6]` /] 
[var name:"death" value:`[7, 8]` /] 
* A cell will become alive if it has [TextInput value:birth style:`{width: "125px"}` autoComplete:"off"/] live neighbors.
* A cell will stay alive if it has [TextInput value:survival style:`{width: "125px"}` autoComplete:"off"/] live neighbors.
* A cell will die if it has [TextInput value:death style:`{width: "125px"}` autoComplete:"off"/] live neighbors.

Did you find any interesting rules? Let's see what Conway found in the next lesson.
