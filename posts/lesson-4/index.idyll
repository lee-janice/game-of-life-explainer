## Identifying Life forms

Let's put aside the philosophical implications for now. 
Something that you may notice from the previous demonstration is that there seem to be common objects in Life, or "Life forms". 
This hadn't gone unnoticed by enthusiasts, and soon a taxonomy of Life's organisms began to emerge. 

[div className:"knowledge-check"]
## Knowledge check

Spend some time running the Game of Life automaton below to see if you can identify different types of Life forms.

[Automaton birth:`[3]` survival:`[2,3]` death:`[0,1,4,5,6,7,8]` numRows:40 numCols:60 /]

## Three common organisms

The three most common types of organisms in Life were:

* what Conway endearingly referred to as *still lifes*, patterns that stay the same from one generation to the next,
* *oscillators*, which eventually return to their initial state, and 
* *spaceships*, which "move" across the grid.

## Knowledge check

Can you classify each type of organism? If you get stuck, try to spot them in the above automaton.

An [incredibly extensive amount of work](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/) has been done to identify and classify different Life forms, and new discoveries are still being made to this day.
